# [L-1] 10% in the max of `PROTOCOL FEE` and `GAS FEE` is too high 
In the `Common.sol` constructor is passing the values to `_maxFeeX64[ ]` of both  `PROTOCOL FEE` and `GAS FEE` 
```solidity
    constructor() {
        _maxFeeX64[FeeType.GAS_FEE] = 1844674407370955264; 
        _maxFeeX64[FeeType.PROTOCOL_FEE] = 1844674407370955264; // 10%
        _initializer = tx.origin;
    }
```
However, 10% is too high. you need to set the max to a reasonable value e.g 3% to incentivize the users to use this protocol  

# [L-2] Use of `transfer()` Might Render ETH Impossible to Withdraw

The contract `Common.sol` uses `transfer()` when transferring ETH to the recipients. 

```solidity
    function withdrawNative(address to) external onlyRole(WITHDRAWER_ROLE) {
        uint256 nativeBalance = address(this).balance;
        if (nativeBalance > 0) {
            payable(to).transfer(nativeBalance); 
        }
    }
```

This has some notable shortcomings when the recipient is a smart contract, making transferring ETH impossible. Specifically, the transfer will inevitably fail when the smart contract
does not implement a payable fallback function, or
implements a payable fallback function which would incur more than 2300 gas units, or
implements a payable fallback function incurring less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

# [L-3] Setting `V3Utils.sol` as admin of Krystal router is too dangerous 

The contract `Common.sol` has an internal swap function [_swap()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-krystal-defi/blob/main/src/Common.sol#L545) which uses the Krystal router.

```solidity
File: Common.sol
545:             (bool success, ) = swapRouter.call(swapData);
```
an attacker can take advantage of the `call()` to trigger other functions in the Krystal router e.g: `withdrawEther()` to steal the funds 

# [L-4] The internal function `Common.sol#_collectFees()` is not triggered in any contract
The [_collectFees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-krystal-defi/blob/main/src/Common.sol#L585-L601) function is not used anywhere.
```solidity 
    function _collectFees(
        INonfungiblePositionManager nfpm,
        uint256 tokenId,
        IERC20 token0,
        IERC20 token1,
        uint128 collectAmount0,
        uint128 collectAmount1
    ) internal returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
``` 
Make sure to update the logic.

# [L-5] Issues due to supporting tokens with Blocklists 
The `Common.sol#_deductFees()` function will transfer fees to FEE TAKER.
However, due to supporting tokens with Blocklists in this protocol, If `FEE_TAKER` gets blockListed users are not able to use the protocol (from the interface)

``` solidity
File: Common.sol

671:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
...
676:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
...
681:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(

```
Also, in `V3Automation.sol#_execute()` function will sub-call to `_decreaseLiquidityAndCollectFees()` to collect the user fees from his position but in case the user gets blacklisted in `token1` or `token1` the OPERATOR will lose gas fees and receive 0 fee
```solidity
File: Common.sol
 function _decreaseLiquidityAndCollectFees(
...
                // return feesToken
                if (fees0Return > 0) {
                    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                        params.token0,
                        params.userAddress,
                        fees0Return
                    );
                }
                if (fees1Return > 0) {
                    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                        params.token1,
                        params.userAddress,
                        fees1Return
                    );
                }

```

# [L-6] The way protocol takes fees does not handle this scenario correctly leading to the loss of the fee
in `V3Utils.sol#onERC721Received()` if 
```solidity
if (instructions.protocolFeeX64 > 0)
```
is true protocol will take fees.
However, in case `instructions.liquidity = 0` and `instructions.compoundFees = false`
the protocol will receive zero fee because  `_decreaseLiquidityAndCollectFees()` send funds directly to user 
```solidity
File: Common.sol
    function _decreaseLiquidityAndCollectFees(DecreaseAndCollectFeesParams memory params) internal returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
....
                uint256 fees0Return = amount0 - positionAmount0;
                uint256 fees1Return = amount1 - positionAmount1;
                // return feesToken
                if (fees0Return > 0) {
                    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(params.token0, params.userAddress, fees0Return);
                }
                if (fees1Return > 0) {
                    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(params.token1, params.userAddress, fees1Return);
                }
            }

```
